On the left side of the underpass, there is a section of the wall that has been painted with graffiti. The graffiti consists of a stylized \"S\" in a purple color, with a curved line extending from the top right to the bottom left. The paint appears to be fading, with some areas showing signs of wear and discoloration.\n\nThe wall itself is constructed of rectangular stone blocks, and the texture of the stone is rough and uneven. The underpass is illuminated by artificial lighting, which casts shadows on the ground and highlights the texture of the stone wall. The ground is a dull gray color, and there are small debris scattered across the surface.\n\nThe style of the image is a straightforward, unembellished photograph with no filters or artistic manipulations. The focus is on the graffiti and the condition of the underpass.
